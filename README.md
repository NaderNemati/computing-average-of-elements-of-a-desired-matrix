# computing-average-of-elements-of-a-desired-matrix
This was my assiginment for programming of parallel algorithms course.
I triied to produce a random matrix.
I did this assignment with 3 different platforms: CUDA, MPI and Open mp.
I tried to use two different global function by cuda : multi block threads and single block threads.
I ran the cuda version in gresearch.google.com and MPI version on ubuntu18.04.
